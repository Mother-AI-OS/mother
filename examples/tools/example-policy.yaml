# Example Mother Tool Policy Configuration
# Place as mother_tool_policy.yaml in project root or ~/.config/mother/

# Enable or disable policy enforcement
enabled: true

# Default action when no specific rule matches
# Options: allow, confirm, deny
default_action: confirm

# Rules based on tool risk level
risk_rules:
  # Low risk: formatters, linters, read-only tools
  low: allow

  # Medium risk: file modification, local network
  medium: confirm

  # High risk: system commands, external network
  high: confirm

  # Critical risk: elevated privileges, sensitive data
  critical: deny

# Tools that are always blocked (regardless of risk level)
blocked_tools:
  # - dangerous-tool
  # - untrusted-tool

# Tools that are always allowed (bypasses risk checks)
allowed_tools:
  # - verified-tool
  # - internal-tool

# Note: This is an example configuration.
# Adjust based on your security requirements.
#
# For enterprise environments, consider:
# - Setting default_action to 'deny'
# - Blocking all critical risk tools
# - Maintaining an explicit allowed_tools list
# - Requiring confirmation for all non-low risk tools
