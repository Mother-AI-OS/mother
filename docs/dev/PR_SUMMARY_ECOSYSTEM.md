# PR Summary: Ecosystem Documentation

**Branch:** `docs/ecosystem-clarity`
**Date:** 2026-01-19

## Summary

This PR clarifies the Mother AI OS ecosystem architecture:
- Mother is the **runtime/orchestrator**
- Sibling repos are **tool repos** that can integrate with Mother but are also independently useful
- Mother works standalone; tool repos are optional enhancements

## What Changed

### New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/ecosystem/OVERVIEW.md` | Canonical ecosystem documentation with architecture diagram, tool catalog, and integration modes |
| `docs/ecosystem/INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md` | Specification for making a tool repo "Mother-compatible" (CLI interface, HTTP API, Python plugin, permissions, audit) |
| `scripts/ecosystem_scan.py` | Local helper to detect sibling repos and report integration status |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Added "Ecosystem: Tool Repos" section explaining the relationship between Mother and sibling repos |

## Architecture Clarified

```
/projects/
├── mother/           # Core runtime (this repo)
│   └── Built-in plugins: filesystem, email, shell, web, pdf, tasks, tor
│
├── contentcraft/     # Standalone: AI content creation (optional)
├── datacraft/        # Standalone: Document processing (optional)
├── mailcraft/        # Standalone: Email management (optional)
├── taxlord/          # Standalone: Tax management (optional)
├── leadengine/       # Standalone: Lead generation (optional)
└── ...               # Other tool repos (optional)
```

**Key principle:** Mother MUST NOT assume sibling repos exist. It should work perfectly with just built-in plugins.

## How to Validate

### 1. Run the ecosystem scanner

```bash
cd /home/amakua/projects/mother
python scripts/ecosystem_scan.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
Mother Ecosystem Scan
============================================================

Root: /home/amakua/projects

Mother Core: /home/amakua/projects/mother (git repo)

Tool Repos:
------------------------------------------------------------

Found:
  * acnjxn              CLI: acnjxn
      Task management with Google Tasks sync
  * contentcraft        CLI: content, contentcraft
      AI content creation for social media, blogs, YouTube
  ...

Summary:
  Mother: Present
  Tool repos found: 8/8
  Unknown dirs: 0
```

### 2. Verify JSON output

```bash
python scripts/ecosystem_scan.py --json | jq '.mother.present'
# Should output: true
```

### 3. Check documentation renders

```bash
# Preview OVERVIEW.md
cat docs/ecosystem/OVERVIEW.md | head -100

# Check links exist
ls -la docs/ecosystem/
```

### 4. Run existing tests

```bash
pytest -q
# Should pass (no test changes)
```

## What Remains (Future Work)

1. **Plugin registry** — Central registry of Mother-compatible tool repos
2. **Automated integration tests** — Test that tool repos can be loaded as plugins
3. **GitHub Actions** — CI job to validate ecosystem docs stay in sync
4. **Tool repo templates** — Cookiecutter template for new Mother-compatible repos
5. **Version compatibility matrix** — Track which tool repo versions work with which Mother versions
